Hi, I’m Deepak Kumar Singh 👋  

I’m a Senior Mobile Application Developer with over 4 years of hands-on experience in building Flutter and Android applications. Most of my work has been in real production environments, where apps are used daily by real users and businesses.

Over the years, I’ve worked on more than 20 mobile applications that are live on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. These apps span multiple domains such as education, healthcare, HRMS, travel, hospitality, and enterprise solutions.

My day-to-day work mainly involves Flutter (Android & iOS) and native Android development using Kotlin and Java. I focus a lot on clean architecture, maintainable code, and performance, especially for apps that scale to thousands of users.

I have strong experience integrating REST APIs, Firebase services, real-time features like chat and notifications, and secure payment gateways including Stripe, Razorpay, DPO, MTN Mobile Money, and Orange Money. I’ve also handled full app deployments, store releases, and post-production support.

Currently, I work as a Lead Mobile Application Developer at Alobha Technologies Pvt. Ltd., where I contribute across the full mobile app lifecycle—from requirements and development to release and maintenance.

I enjoy building practical solutions, learning new things, and improving code quality over time.

Tech I work with:
- Flutter (Android & iOS)
- Android (Kotlin, Java)
- Dart
- MVVM, Provider, GetX
- REST APIs, Firebase
- Payment integrations
- Play Store & App Store deployment
